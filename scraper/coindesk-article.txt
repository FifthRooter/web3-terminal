    "text": "“We view it [the investment] a little bit like when we made our investment in OpenSea back in 2019,” Siu told CDTV. ”One of the reasons we made that investment was because we wanted to sort of help build the rails of that NFT economy, which back then was nonexistent, and today has become fairly meaningful.”"
