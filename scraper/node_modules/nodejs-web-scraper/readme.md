nodejs-web-scraper is a simple tool for scraping/crawling server-side rendered pages.
It supports features like recursive scraping(pages that "open" other pages), file download and handling, automatic retries of failed requests, concurrency limitation, pagination, request delay, etc. Tested on Node 10 - 16(Windows 7, Linux Mint).

The API uses Cheerio selectors. [Click here for reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)

## Basic examples
#### Collect articles from a news site

Let's say we want to get every article(from every category), from a news site. We want each item to contain the title,
story and image link(or links).

```javascript
const { Scraper, Root, DownloadContent, OpenLinks, CollectContent } = require('nodejs-web-scraper');
const fs = require('fs');

(async () => {

    const config = {
        baseSiteUrl: `https://www.some-news-site.com/`,
        startUrl: `https://www.some-news-site.com/`,
        filePath: './images/',
        concurrency: 10,//Maximum concurrent jobs. More than 10 is not recommended.Default is 3.
        maxRetries: 3,//The scraper will try to repeat a failed request few times(excluding 404). Default is 5.       
        logPath: './logs/'//Highly recommended: Creates a friendly JSON for each operation object, with all the relevant data. 
    }
    

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);//Create a new Scraper instance, and pass config to it.

    //Now we create the "operations" we need:

    const root = new Root();//The root object fetches the startUrl, and starts the process.  
 
    //Any valid cheerio selector can be passed. For further reference: https://cheerio.js.org/
    const category = new OpenLinks('.category',{name:'category'});//Opens each category page.

    const article = new OpenLinks('article a', {name:'article' });//Opens each article page.

    const image = new DownloadContent('img', { name: 'image' });//Downloads images.

    const title = new CollectContent('h1', { name: 'title' });//"Collects" the text from each H1 element.

    const story = new CollectContent('section.content', { name: 'story' });//"Collects" the the article body.

    root.addOperation(category);//Then we create a scraping "tree":
      category.addOperation(article);
       article.addOperation(image);
       article.addOperation(title);
       article.addOperation(story);

    await scraper.scrape(root);

    const articles = article.getData()//Will return an array of all article objects(from all categories), each
    //containing its "children"(titles,stories and the downloaded image urls) 

    //If you just want to get the stories, do the same with the "story" variable:
    const stories = story.getData();

    fs.writeFile('./articles.json', JSON.stringify(articles), () => { })//Will produce a formatted JSON containing all article pages and their selected data.

    fs.writeFile('./stories.json', JSON.stringify(stories), () => { })
    

})();    

```
This basically means: "go to https://www.some-news-site.com; Open every category; Then open every article in each category page; Then collect the title, story and image href, and download all images on that page".

&nbsp;

#### Get data of every page as a dictionary

An alternative, perhaps more firendly way to collect the data from a page, would be to use the "getPageObject" hook. 

```javascript

const { Scraper, Root, OpenLinks, CollectContent, DownloadContent } = require('nodejs-web-scraper');
const fs = require('fs');

(async () => {

    const pages = [];//All ad pages.

    //pageObject will be formatted as {title,phone,images}, becuase these are the names we chose for the scraping operations below.
    //Note that each key is an array, because there might be multiple elements fitting the querySelector.
    //This hook is called after every page finished scraping.
    //It will also get an address argument. 
    const getPageObject = (pageObject,address) => {                  
        pages.push(pageObject)
    }

    const config = {
        baseSiteUrl: `https://www.profesia.sk`,
        startUrl: `https://www.profesia.sk/praca/`,
        filePath: './images/',
        logPath: './logs/'
    }

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);

    const root = new Root();//Open pages 1-10. You need to supply the querystring that the site uses(more details in the API docs).

    const jobAds = new OpenLinks('.list-row h2 a', { name: 'Ad page', getPageObject });//Opens every job ad, and calls the getPageObject, passing the formatted dictionary.

    const phones = new CollectContent('.details-desc a.tel', { name: 'phone' })//Important to choose a name, for the getPageObject to produce the expected results.

    const titles = new CollectContent('h1', { name: 'title' });

    root.addOperation(jobAds);
     jobAds.addOperation(titles);
     jobAds.addOperation(phones);

    await scraper.scrape(root);
    
    fs.writeFile('./pages.json', JSON.stringify(pages), () => { });//Produces a formatted JSON with all job ads.
})()

```
Let's describe again in words, what's going on here: "Go to https://www.profesia.sk/praca/; Then paginate the root page, from 1 to 10; Then, on each pagination page, open every job ad; Then, collect the title, phone and images of each ad."

&nbsp;

#### Download all images from a page

A simple task to download all images in a page(including base64)

```javascript
const { Scraper, Root, DownloadContent } = require('nodejs-web-scraper');

(async () => {

   const config = {
        baseSiteUrl: `https://spectator.sme.sk`,//Important to provide the base url, which is the same as the starting url, in this example.
        startUrl: `https://spectator.sme.sk/`,
        filePath: './images/',
        cloneFiles: true,//Will create a new image file with an appended name, if the name already exists. Default is false. 
       }

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);

    const root = new Root();//Root corresponds to the config.startUrl. This object starts the entire process

    const images = new DownloadContent('img')//Create an operation that downloads all image tags in a given page(any Cheerio selector can be passed).

    root.addOperation(images);//We want to download the images from the root page, we need to Pass the "images" operation to the root.

    await scraper.scrape(root);//Pass the Root to the Scraper.scrape() and you're done.

})();    

```
When done, you will have an "images" folder with all downloaded files.

&nbsp;

#### Use multiple selectors

If you need to select elements from different possible classes("or" operator), just pass comma separated classes.
This is part of the Jquery specification(which Cheerio implemets), and has nothing to do with the scraper.

```javascript
const { Scraper, Root, CollectContent } = require('nodejs-web-scraper');

(async () => {

   const config = {
        baseSiteUrl: `https://spectator.sme.sk`,
        startUrl: `https://spectator.sme.sk/`,           
       }

    function getElementContent(element){
        // Do something...
    }   

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);

    const root = new Root();

    const title = new CollectContent('.first_class, .second_class',{getElementContent});//Any of these will fit.

    root.addOperation(title);

    await scraper.scrape(root);

})();    

```

&nbsp;


## Advanced Examples




#### Pagination

Get every job ad from a job-offering site. Each job object will contain a title, a phone and image hrefs. Being that the site is paginated, use the pagination feature.

```javascript

const { Scraper, Root, OpenLinks, CollectContent, DownloadContent } = require('nodejs-web-scraper');
const fs = require('fs');

(async () => {

    const pages = [];//All ad pages.

    //pageObject will be formatted as {title,phone,images}, becuase these are the names we chose for the scraping operations below.
    const getPageObject = (pageObject,address) => {                  
        pages.push(pageObject)
    }

    const config = {
        baseSiteUrl: `https://www.profesia.sk`,
        startUrl: `https://www.profesia.sk/praca/`,
        filePath: './images/',
        logPath: './logs/'
    }

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);

    const root = new Root({ pagination: { queryString: 'page_num', begin: 1, end: 10 } });//Open pages 1-10.
    // YOU NEED TO SUPPLY THE QUERYSTRING that the site uses(more details in the API docs). "page_num" is just the string used on this example site.

    const jobAds = new OpenLinks('.list-row h2 a', { name: 'Ad page', getPageObject });//Opens every job ad, and calls the getPageObject, passing the formatted object.

    const phones = new CollectContent('.details-desc a.tel', { name: 'phone' })//Important to choose a name, for the getPageObject to produce the expected results.

    const images = new DownloadContent('img', { name: 'images' })

    const titles = new CollectContent('h1', { name: 'title' });

    root.addOperation(jobAds);
     jobAds.addOperation(titles);
     jobAds.addOperation(phones);
     jobAds.addOperation(images);

    await scraper.scrape(root);
    
    fs.writeFile('./pages.json', JSON.stringify(pages), () => { });//Produces a formatted JSON with all job ads.
})()

```
Let's describe again in words, what's going on here: "Go to https://www.profesia.sk/praca/; Then paginate the root page, from 1 to 10; Then, on each pagination page, open every job ad; Then, collect the title, phone and images of each ad."

&nbsp;

#### Get an entire HTML file

```javascript

const sanitize = require('sanitize-filename');//Using this npm module to sanitize file names.
const fs = require('fs');
const { Scraper, Root, OpenLinks } = require('nodejs-web-scraper');

(async () => {
    const config = {
        baseSiteUrl: `https://www.profesia.sk`,
        startUrl: `https://www.profesia.sk/praca/`,
        removeStyleAndScriptTags: false//Telling the scraper NOT to remove style and script tags, cause i want it in my html files, for this example.        
    }

    let directoryExists;

    const getPageHtml = (html, pageAddress) => {//Saving the HTML file, using the page address as a name.

        if(!directoryExists){
            fs.mkdirSync('./html');
            directoryExists = true;
        }
        const name = sanitize(pageAddress)
        fs.writeFile(`./html/${name}.html`, html, () => { })
    }

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);

    const root = new Root({ pagination: { queryString: 'page_num', begin: 1, end: 100 } });

    const jobAds = new OpenLinks('.list-row h2 a', { getPageHtml });//Opens every job ad, and calls a hook after every page is done.

    root.addOperation(jobAds);

    await scraper.scrape(root);
})() 

```
Description: "Go to https://www.profesia.sk/praca/; Paginate 100 pages from the root; Open every job ad; Save every job ad page as an html file;


&nbsp;

#### Downloading a file that is not an image



```javascript

  const config = {        
        baseSiteUrl: `https://www.some-content-site.com`,
        startUrl: `https://www.some-content-site.com/videos`,
        filePath: './videos/',
        logPath: './logs/'
    }
   

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);   

    const root = new Root();

    const video = new DownloadContent('a.video',{ contentType: 'file' });//The "contentType" makes it clear for the scraper that this is NOT an image(therefore the "href is used instead of "src"). 

    const description = new CollectContent('h1').       

    root.addOperation(video);      
    root.addOperation(description);

   await scraper.scrape(root);

    console.log(description.getData())//You can call the "getData" method on every operation object, giving you the aggregated data collected by it.
```
Description: "Go to https://www.some-content-site.com; Download every video; Collect each h1; At the end, get the entire data from the "description" object;


&nbsp;

#### getElementContent and getPageResponse hooks

```javascript

  const getPageResponse = async (response) => {
        //Do something with response.data(the HTML content). No need to return anything.
    }

    const myDivs=[];

    const getElementContent = (content, pageAddress) => {
               
        myDivs.push(`myDiv content from page ${pageAddress} is ${content}...`)
    }

    const config = {        
        baseSiteUrl: `https://www.nice-site`,
        startUrl: `https://www.nice-site/some-section`,       
       }

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);

    const root = new Root();

    const articles = new OpenLinks('article a');

    const posts = new OpenLinks('.post a'{getPageResponse});//Is called after the HTML of a link was fetched, but before the children have been scraped. Is passed the response object of the page.    

    const myDiv = new CollectContent('.myDiv',{getElementContent});//Will be called after every "myDiv" element is collected.

    root.addOperation(articles);      
        articles.addOperation(myDiv);
    root.addOperation(posts);
        posts.addOperation(myDiv)   

   await scraper.scrape(root);
    
```
Description: "Go to https://www.nice-site/some-section; Open every article link; Collect each .myDiv; Call getElementContent()".

"Also, from https://www.nice-site/some-section, open every post; Before scraping the children(myDiv object), call getPageResponse(); CollCollect each .myDiv".

&nbsp;

#### Add additional conditions

In some cases, using the cheerio selectors isn't enough to properly filter the DOM nodes. This is where the "condition" hook comes in. Both OpenLinks and DownloadContent can register a function with this hook, allowing you to decide if this DOM node should be scraped, by returning true or false.

```javascript  

    
    const config = {        
        baseSiteUrl: `https://www.nice-site`,
        startUrl: `https://www.nice-site/some-section`,       
       }

    /**
     * Will be called for each node collected by cheerio, in the given operation(OpenLinks or DownloadContent)      
     */
   const condition = (cheerioNode) => {      
         //Note that cheerioNode contains other useful methods, like html(), hasClass(), parent(), attr() and more.           
        const text = cheerioNode.text().trim();//Get the innerText of the <a> tag.
        if(text === 'some text i am looking for'){//Even though many links might fit the querySelector, Only those that have this innerText,
        // will be "opened".
            return true
        }
    }   

    const scraper = new Scraper(config);

    const root = new Root();

    //Let's assume this page has many links with the same CSS class, but not all are what we need.
    const linksToOpen = new OpenLinks('some-css-class-that-is-just-not-enough',{condition});    

    root.addOperation(linksToOpen);      
          

   await scraper.scrape(root);
    
```

&nbsp;

## API

### class Scraper(config)

The main nodejs-web-scraper object. Starts the entire scraping process via Scraper.scrape(Root). Holds the configuration and global state.

These are the available options for the scraper, with their default values:

```javascript
const config ={
            baseSiteUrl: '',//Mandatory.If your site sits in a subfolder, provide the path WITHOUT it.
            startUrl: '',//Mandatory. The page from which the process begins.   
            logPath:null,//Highly recommended.Will create a log for each scraping operation(object).               
            cloneFiles: true,//If an image with the same name exists, a new file with a number appended to it is created. Otherwise. it's overwritten.
            removeStyleAndScriptTags: true,// Removes any <style> and <script> tags found on the page, in order to serve Cheerio with a light-weight string. change this ONLY if you have to.           
            concurrency: 3,//Maximum concurrent requests.Highly recommended to keep it at 10 at most. 
            maxRetries: 5,//Maximum number of retries of a failed request.      
            delay: 200,
            timeout: 6000,
            filePath: null,//Needs to be provided only if a "downloadContent" operation is created.
            auth: null,//Can provide basic auth credentials(no clue what sites actually use it)
            headers: null,//Provide custom headers for the requests.           
            proxy:null,//Use a proxy. Pass a full proxy URL, including the protocol and the port.           
            showConsoleLogs:true,//Set to false, if you want to disable the messages
            onError:null//callback function that is called whenever an error occurs - signature is: onError(errorString) => {}
        }
```
Public methods:

| Name                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| async scrape(Root)                       | After all objects have been created and assembled, you begin the process by calling this method, passing the root object 


&nbsp;

 

### class Root([config])


Root is responsible for fetching the first page, and then scrape the children. It can also be paginated, hence the optional config. For instance:
```javascript
const root= new Root({ pagination: { queryString: 'page', begin: 1, end: 100 }})

```
The optional config takes these properties:
```javascript
{    
    pagination:{},//In case your root page is paginated.    
    getPageObject:(pageObject,address)=>{},//Gets a formatted page object with all the data we choose in our scraping setup. Also gets an address argument.
    getPageHtml:(htmlString,pageAddress)=>{}//Get the entire html page, and also the page address. Called with each link opened by this OpenLinks object.  
    getPageData:(cleanData)=>{}//Called after all data was collected by the root and its children.
    getPageResponse:(response)=>{}//Will be called after a link's html was fetched, but BEFORE the child operations are performed on it(like, collecting some data from it). Is passed the response object(a custom response object, that also contains the original node-fetch response). Notice that any modification to this object, might result in an unexpected behavior with the child operations of that page.
    getException:(error)=>{}//Get every exception thrown by Root.  
    
}

```

Public methods:

| Name        | Description                                                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| addOperation(Operation)   | (OpenLinks,DownloadContent,CollectContent)                                        |
| getData()   | Gets all data collected by this operation. In the case of root, it will just be the entire scraping tree. |
| getErrors() | In the case of root, it will show all errors in every operation.                                          |

&nbsp;

### class OpenLinks(querySelector,[config])

Responsible for "opening links" in a given page. Basically it just creates a nodelist of anchor elements, fetches their html, and continues the process of scraping, in those pages - according to the user-defined scraping tree.

The optional config can have these properties:

```javascript
{
    name:'some name',//Like every operation object, you can specify a name, for better clarity in the logs.
    pagination:{},//Look at the pagination API for more details.
    condition:(cheerioNode)=>{},//Use this hook to add additional filter to the nodes that were received by the querySelector. Return true to include, falsy to exclude.
    getPageObject:(pageObject,address)=>{},//Gets a formatted page object with all the data we choose in our scraping setup. Also gets an address argument.
    getPageHtml:(htmlString,pageAddress)=>{}//Get the entire html page, and also the page address. Called with each link opened by this OpenLinks object.
    getElementList:(elementList)=>{},//Is called each time an element list is created. In the case of OpenLinks, will happen with each list of anchor tags that it collects. Those elements all have Cheerio methods available to them.
    getPageData:(cleanData)=>{}//Called after all data was collected from a link, opened by this object.(if a given page has 10 links, it will be called 10 times, with the child data).
    getPageResponse:(response)=>{}//Will be called after a link's html was fetched, but BEFORE the child operations are performed on it(like, collecting some data from it). Is passed the response object(a custom response object, that also contains the original node-fetch response). Notice that any modification to this object, might result in an unexpected behavior with the child operations of that page.
    getException:(error)=>{}//Get every exception throw by this openLinks operation, even if this was later repeated successfully.
    slice:[start,end]//You can define a certain range of elements from the node list.Also possible to pass just a number, instead of an array, if you only want to specify the start. This uses the Cheerio/Jquery slice method.
}

```
Public methods:

| Name        | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| addOperation(Operation)   | Add a scraping "operation"(OpenLinks,DownloadContent,CollectContent)  |
| getData()   | Will get the data from all pages processed by this operation |

### class CollectContent(querySelector,[config])
Responsible for simply collecting text/html from a given page.
The optional config can receive these properties:
```javascript
{
    name:'some name',
    contentType:'text',//Either 'text' or 'html'. Default is text.   
    shouldTrim:true,//Default is true. Applies JS String.trim() method.
    getElementList:(elementList,pageAddress)=>{},  
    getElementContent:(elementContentString,pageAddress)=>{}//Called with each element collected.
    getAllItems: (items, address)=>{}//Called after an entire page has its elements collected.  
    slice:[start,end]
}

```
Public methods:

| Name      | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| getData() | Gets all data collected by this operation. |

&nbsp;

### class DownloadContent(querySelector,[config])
Responsible downloading files/images from a given page.
The optional config can receive these properties:
```javascript
{
    name:'some name',
    contentType:'image',//Either 'image' or 'file'. Default is image.
    alternativeSrc:['first-alternative','second-alternative']//Provide alternative attributes to be used as the src. Will only be invoked,
    //If the "src" attribute is undefined or is a dataUrl. If no matching alternative is found, the dataUrl is used. 
    condition:(cheerioNode)=>{},//Use this hook to add additional filter to the nodes that were received by the querySelector. Return true to include, falsy to exclude.
    getElementList:(elementList)=>{},
    getException:(error)=>{}//Get every exception throw by this downloadContent operation, even if this was later repeated successfully.
    filePath:'./somePath',//Overrides the global filePath passed to the Scraper config.  
    slice:[start,end]
}

```


Public methods:

| Name        | Description                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| getData()   | Gets all file names that were downloaded, and their relevant data |
| getErrors() | Gets all errors encountered by this operation.                    |

## Pagination explained
nodejs-web-scraper covers most scenarios of pagination(assuming it's server-side rendered of course).



``` javascript

    //If a site uses a queryString for pagination, this is how it's done:

    const productPages = new openLinks('a.product'{ pagination: { queryString: 'page_num', begin: 1, end: 1000 } });//You need to specify the query string that the site uses for pagination, and the page range you're interested in.

    //If the site uses some kind of offset(like Google search results), instead of just incrementing by one, you can do it this way:
    
    { pagination: { queryString: 'page_num', begin: 1, end: 100,offset:10 } }

    //If the site uses routing-based pagination:

    { pagination: { routingString: '/', begin: 1, end: 100 } }
```

&nbsp;

## Error Handling

nodejs-web-scraper will automatically repeat every failed request(except 404,400,403 and invalid images). Number of repetitions depends on the global config option "maxRetries", which you pass to the Scraper. If a request fails "indefinitely", it will be skipped. After the entire scraping process is complete, all "final" errors will be printed as a JSON into a file called **"finalErrors.json"**(assuming you provided a logPath). 

Alternatively, use the `onError` callback function in the scraper's global config.


## Automatic logs
If a logPath was provided, the scraper will create a log for each operation object you create, and also the following ones: "log.json"(summary of the entire scraping tree), and "finalErrors.json"(an array of all FINAL errors encountered). I really recommend using this feature, along side your own hooks and data handling.


## Concurrency

The program uses a rather complex concurrency management. Being that the memory consumption can get very high in certain scenarios, I've force-limited the concurrency of pagination and "nested" OpenLinks operations. It should still be very quick. As a general note, i recommend to limit the concurrency to 10 at most. Also the config.delay is a key a factor.
